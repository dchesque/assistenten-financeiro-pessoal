# AI Agent Guidelines

# AI Agent Guidelines for Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal Codebase

## 1. Code Style Preferences
- **When writing TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) files, always follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**, which is widely adopted in this codebase. Maintain consistent use of semicolons, single quotes for strings, and indentation of 2 spaces.
- **Always use functional components and hooks** instead of class components for React components, as the codebase primarily utilizes functional programming patterns.
- **Ensure consistent naming conventions**: use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for component names, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- **When adding new files, always ensure they are properly named** following the `ComponentName.tsx` format for components and `hookName.ts` for hooks.

## 2. Decision Frameworks
- **Prefer using existing hooks from the Hooks module over writing new ones** unless the functionality is significantly different. This promotes reusability and consistency across the codebase.
- **When integrating new libraries or services, evaluate existing integrations in the Integrations module** first to determine if the functionality can be reused or extended. Always consider the impact on bundle size and performance.
- **For state management, prefer using React Context API or custom hooks** over third-party libraries unless the complexity of the state management warrants it.

## 3. Risk Areas
- **Pay special attention to the Components module**, as it contains the UI elements. Any changes here can affect the entire user interface; therefore, ensure thorough testing with existing components.
- **Validate SQL queries in the Services module** carefully, as incorrect queries can lead to data integrity issues. Always double-check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Be cautious with external API integrations** in the Services module. Ensure that error handling is robust and that there are fallback mechanisms for failures.

## 4. Validation Steps
- **Before suggesting changes to any component**, ensure you have run the existing test suite to confirm that the current implementation is functioning as expected. 
- **Before changing API endpoints in the Services module, validate that the new endpoints are documented** and that the necessary changes in the consuming components are identified.
- **When modifying styles or layout in the Components module, check the current design specifications** to ensure compliance with the intended UI/UX design guidelines.

## 5. Context Clues
- **To understand the intent behind existing code, always read the accompanying comments and documentation** in the Docs module. This can provide valuable insights into why certain decisions were made.
- **Look for patterns in how components are structured and how props are passed**. This can inform how to extend or modify existing components without breaking existing functionality.
- **If you encounter complex logic, break it down and trace the flow of data** through the application. Understanding how data is being manipulated will help clarify the purpose of the implementation.

By adhering to these guidelines, AI agents can enhance consistency, reduce errors, and maintain the quality of the codebase within the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal project.
