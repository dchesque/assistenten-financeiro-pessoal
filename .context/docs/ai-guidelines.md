# AI Agent Guidelines for Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal Codebase

## 1. Code Style Preferences
- **When writing .tsx files**, always use JSX syntax for components and ensure proper indentation (2 spaces).
- **For TypeScript (.ts) files**, prefer using interfaces over types for defining object shapes to maintain consistency.
- **When naming variables and functions**, use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for component names.
- **Always use single quotes** for strings unless interpolation is necessary.
- **Place imports** at the top of the file, grouped in the following order: external libraries, internal modules, and styles.
- **When writing comments**, use JSDoc format for functions and components to provide descriptive context for parameters and return values.

## 2. Decision Frameworks
- **Prefer functional components over class components** for new React components to leverage hooks and simplify code.
- **When introducing new dependencies**, always check if an existing package can fulfill the requirement to avoid bloat. If necessary, prefer well-maintained libraries with active community support.
- **For state management**, prefer using React's built-in hooks (useState, useReducer) over external libraries unless the complexity requires it.
- **When handling API responses**, always validate the response schema using TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety.

## 3. Risk Areas
- **Be cautious with state management in Hooks**: Ensure the proper use of dependencies in useEffect to prevent infinite loops or missed updates.
- **Pay extra attention to SQL queries** in the Repositories module: Always sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection.
- **When modifying integrations**, thoroughly review the impact on external services to avoid breaking existing functionalities.
- **Validate all user inputs** in forms to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Validation Steps
- **Before suggesting changes to existing components**, check if the component has associated tests and ensure they pass.
- **When changing any configuration files (e.g., tsconfig.json, package.json)**, validate that existing scripts and modules are compatible with the new configurations.
- **Before changing SQL queries**, run the existing queries to verify their functionality and performance.
- **Always test changes locally** before proposing them, ensuring that all unit tests and integration tests pass.

## 5. Context Clues
- **To understand the intent behind existing code**, read through comments and commit messages to gather insights into the developer's reasoning.
- **Look for patterns in existing components**: If a component is structured in a certain way, follow that structure for new components to maintain consistency.
- **Refer to existing tests** in the Tests directory to understand the expected behavior of components and functions. This will guide modifications and ensure compatibility.
- **When reviewing the Docs module**, check for any architectural decisions or rationale provided that may inform your understanding of the codebase structure.

By adhering to these guidelines, AI assistants can help maintain code quality and consistency within the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal codebase, minimizing common pitfalls and enhancing collaboration among developers.
