# Contributing Workflows Guide

Welcome to the contributing guide for the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal project! This document outlines the workflows and processes that every contributor should follow to ensure smooth collaboration, high code quality, and efficient deployment. Whether you're new to the project or an experienced contributor, this guide will help you navigate the development lifecycle, understand our code review process, and more.

## 1. Development Lifecycle: From Idea to Deployment

The development lifecycle is a structured approach that helps us turn ideas into deployed features efficiently. The process typically follows these steps:

### **Step 1: Idea Generation**
- **What**: Propose new features, enhancements, or bug fixes.
- **Why**: Gathering ideas ensures the project evolves according to user needs.
- **How**: Use GitHub Issues to create a proposal or document the idea in a shared channel.

### **Step 2: Issue Creation**
- Create a GitHub Issue for your proposed work, detailing the problem, solution, and any relevant context.

### **Step 3: Development Branching**
- **What**: Create a feature branch off the `main` branch.
- **Why**: Isolating changes in branches helps maintain the stability of the main codebase.
- **How**: Use naming conventions like `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`.

### **Step 4: Coding**
- Develop your feature with best practices in mind, ensuring readability and maintainability.
- **Tools**: Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.

### **Step 5: Commit and Push Changes**
- **What**: Commit your work with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Why**: Clear commit history helps track changes and understand project evolution.
- **How**: Follow conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: add new feature`).

### **Step 6: Pull Request (PR) Submission**
- **What**: Submit a PR for review to the `main` branch.
- **Why**: PRs facilitate code reviews and discussions about changes.
- **How**: Describe the changes and link any relevant issues.

## 2. Code Review Process: What Gets Reviewed and How

Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and catching potential issues early.

### **What Gets Reviewed**
- Code functionality: Does it work as intended?
- Code quality: Is the code clean, readable, and well-structured?
- Tests: Are there sufficient tests to cover the changes?
- Documentation: Are any updates required for README or other documentation?

### **How**
- **Reviewers**: At least two reviewers must approve a PR before merging.
- **Tools**: Use GitHub's built-in review features to comment, request changes, or approve.
- **Feedback**: Constructive feedback is encouraged; focus on improvement.

## 3. Testing Requirements: What Testing is Expected

Testing is crucial to ensure our code works as expected and prevents regressions.

### **Types of Tests**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components or functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Test how different parts of the application work together.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate user interactions in the application.

### **Expectations**
- New features must include corresponding tests.
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing.
- Ensure tests run successfully before submitting a PR.

## 4. Release Process: How Changes Get Deployed

Deploying changes is the culmination of our development efforts and must be done carefully.

### **Step-by-Step Release Process**
1. **Merge PRs**: Only after approval from reviewers.
2. **Version Bump**: Update the version number in `package.json`.
3. **Changelog Update**: Document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. **Create a Release**: Tag the release in GitHub.
5. **Deploy**: Use CI/CD tools (like GitHub Actions) to automatically deploy the code to production.

### **Quality Gates**
- Ensure all tests pass before merging.
- Perform a final review of code for any last-minute issues.

## 5. Communication: How Team Members Coordinate

Effective communication is key to successful collaboration.

### **Channels**
- **GitHub Issues/PRs**: Use these for discussions on features or bugs.
- **Slack/Teams**: For informal communication and quick questions.
- **Weekly Syncs**: Regular team meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks.

### **Best Practices**
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
- Provide updates on your progress and raise any blockers early.
- Encourage team collaboration; pair programming is welcome!

## Conclusion

Following these workflows ensures that the development process is smooth, efficient, and results in high-quality software. By adhering to these standards, we can maintain a productive environment where contributors feel valued and empowered to create. Thank you for contributing to Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal!
