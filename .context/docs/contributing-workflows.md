# Contributing Workflows

# Contributing Workflows Guide

Welcome to the contributing guide for the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal codebase! This document outlines the workflows, processes, and expectations for contributing to this project. Whether you are a new or experienced contributor, following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration.

## 1. Development Lifecycle: From Idea to Deployment

### Step-by-Step Workflow:
1. **Idea Generation**:
   - Identify a problem or opportunity for improvement.
   - Discuss your idea with team members to validate its importance and feasibility.

2. **Create an Issue**:
   - Open a new issue in the repository’s issue tracker.
   - Provide a clear title and description. Tag it appropriately (feature, bug, etc.).

3. **Design and Planning**:
   - Define the scope of your work.
   - Create a design document if necessary, outlining the implementation approach.

4. **Develop**:
   - Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
   - Create a new branch for your feature or fix (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`).
   - Write clean, maintainable code, adhering to existing coding standards.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update any relevant documentation (README, usage examples) to reflect your changes.

6. **Commit**:
   - Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages (e.g., “Added user authentication feature”).
   - Ensure your commits are atomic; each commit should represent a single logical change.

7. **Push Changes**:
   - Push your branch to the remote repository.

8. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Navigate to the original repository and open a PR from your branch.
   - Clearly describe the changes and reference the issue it addresses.

### Quality Gates and Checkpoints:
- Ensure your code passes linters and adheres to our coding style.
- Check if your changes are covered by tests before pushing.

### Why This Exists:
This structured workflow helps manage contributions effectively, ensures clarity on changes being made, and maintains code quality across the project.

## 2. Code Review Process: What Gets Reviewed and How

### Step-by-Step Workflow:
1. **Request Review**:
   - After opening a PR, request reviews from at least two team members.

2. **Review Criteria**:
   - Code correctness: Does it work as intended?
   - Code quality: Is it clean, readable, and maintainable?
   - Testing: Are there adequate tests? Do they pass?
   - Documentation: Is everything well documented?

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Reviewers provide feedback directly in the PR.
   - Address feedback by making changes in your branch and pushing updates.

4. **Approval**:
   - Once all reviewers approve, the PR can be merged.

### Tools and Automation:
- Use CI/CD tools (like GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests and linters on PRs.
- Utilize code review tools integrated into the platform (e.g., GitHub’s review comments).

### Why This Exists:
The code review process ensures quality, increases knowledge sharing among team members, and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs.

## 3. Testing Requirements: What Testing is Expected

### Testing Expectations:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Ensure that new integrations or components work seamlessly with existing ones.

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - For UI components, conduct manual testing to ensure expected behavior.

### Tools Used:
- Use testing frameworks (like Jest or Mocha) for unit and integration tests.
- Tools like Cypress can be used for end-to-end testing.

### Why This Exists:
Testing helps catch bugs early, improves code reliability, and provides confidence in the codebase as it evolves.

## 4. Release Process: How Changes Get Deployed

### Step-by-Step Workflow:
1. **Merging PRs**:
   - After approval, merge the PR into the main branch.

2. **Versioning**:
   - Update the version number in `package.json` according to semantic versioning (major.minor.patch).

3. **Build**:
   - Trigger the build process using CI/CD tools to create deployable artifacts.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy changes to the staging environment for final testing.
   - Once verified, deploy to production.

### Tools and Automation:
- Use CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) for automated testing and deployment.
- Docker can be used to containerize applications, ensuring consistency across environments.

### Why This Exists:
A clear release process ensures that deployments are predictable, reducing downtime and errors in production.

## 5. Communication: How Team Members Coordinate

### Communication Guidelines:
1. **Regular Meetings**:
   - Participate in daily stand-ups or weekly planning meetings to discuss progress and blockers.

2. **Use Issues and PR Comments**:
   - Document discussions and feedback in issues and PR comments for transparency.

3. **Chat Tools**:
   - Utilize chat tools (like Slack or Discord) for quick communication and updates.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep documentation up to date to facilitate knowledge transfer among team members.

### Why This Exists:
Effective communication fosters collaboration, ensures that everyone is aligned on goals, and helps in quickly resolving issues.

## Conclusion

By following this Contributing Workflows guide, you contribute to a culture of quality and collaboration within the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal codebase. Thank you for helping improve the project! Happy coding!
