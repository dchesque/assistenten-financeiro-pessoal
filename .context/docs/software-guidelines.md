# Software Development Guidelines

# Comprehensive Software Development Guidelines for the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal Codebase

## 1. Technology-Specific Guidelines

### 1.1 TypeScript Best Practices
- **Type Annotations**: Always use type annotations for function parameters and return types. This enhances code readability and reduces runtime errors.
  ```typescript
  function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```
- **Interfaces and Types**: Use interfaces for object shapes and types for function signatures and unions. Prefer interfaces for public API definitions.
  ```typescript
  interface User {
      id: number;
      name: string;
      email: string;
  }
  ```
- **Avoid Any**: Never use the `any` type. Instead, define specific types that accurately represent your data.

### 1.2 React (TSX) Best Practices
- **Functional Components**: Prefer functional components over class components. Utilize React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
  ```tsx
  const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
  };
  ```
- **Prop Validation**: Use TypeScript for prop validation instead of PropTypes. Define prop types directly in your component’s signature.

### 1.3 SQL Best Practices
- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?;
  ```
- **Indexing**: Use indexes judiciously to optimize performance for frequently queried columns.

## 2. Project-Specific Patterns

### 2.1 File Structure
- **Component Structure**: Each component should reside in its own directory containing its `.tsx`, `.css`, and test files.
  ```
  /components
      /Button
          Button.tsx
          Button.test.tsx
          Button.css
  ```

### 2.2 State Management
- Utilize React Context or Redux for global state management. Keep local component state minimal—use props to pass data down.

### 2.3 Hooks Usage
- Custom hooks should be prefixed with "use" and should encapsulate reusable logic.
  ```typescript
  function useFetch(url: string) { ... }
  ```

## 3. Quality Standards

### 3.1 Code Quality
- **Linting**: Use ESLint with TypeScript support. Follow the recommended ESLint configuration.
- **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting. Ensure all code is formatted before commits using a pre-commit hook.

### 3.2 Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all components and utility functions. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
- **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests for components that interact with APIs or involve multiple components.

### 3.3 Code Reviews
- **Pull Requests**: All code should be submitted via pull requests. Each PR should be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
- **Checklist**: Use a checklist for PR reviews that includes verifying tests, linting, and code quality.

## 4. Workflow Guidelines

### 4.1 Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Use descriptive names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).
- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch should always contain stable, production-ready code.

### 4.2 Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow the conventional commits format:
  - `feat: add new authentication feature`
  - `fix: resolve bug in user profile`

### 4.3 Agile Practices
- Conduct regular stand-ups and maintain a clear Kanban board for task management. Use tools like Jira or Trello for tracking.

## 5. Security & Performance

### 5.1 Security Guidelines
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as API keys in environment variables. Use a `.env` file for local development.
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` to check for security issues.

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports for large components to reduce initial load time.
- **Memoization**: Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

## Tool Recommendations
- **ESLint**: For linting TypeScript and TSX.
- **Prettier**: For code formatting.
- **Jest**: For unit testing.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
- **Husky**: For managing Git hooks (e.g., pre-commit linting).
- **npm audit**: For checking dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain at least 80% code coverage.
- **Linting**: Ensure all code passes ESLint checks before merging.
- **Test Pass Rates**: All tests must pass before a PR can be merged.

These guidelines are designed to help developers effectively contribute to the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal codebase while maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and performance. Following these principles will foster a collaborative and efficient development environment.
