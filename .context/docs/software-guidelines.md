# Software Development Guidelines for Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal

These guidelines are designed to facilitate effective development practices within the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal codebase. They cover technology-specific best practices, project-specific patterns, quality standards, workflow processes, and security & performance considerations.

## 1. Technology-Specific Guidelines

### TypeScript and React (.tsx and .ts)
- **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript's static typing. Define interfaces and types for props and state in React components.
  - **Example**: 
    ```typescript
    interface UserProps {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProps> = ({ name, age }) => {
        return <div>{name} is {age} years old.</div>;
    };
    ```

- **Functional Components**: Prefer using functional components with hooks over class components.
  - **Example**:
    ```typescript
    const Counter: React.FC = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
    };
    ```

- **Hooks**: Follow the rules of hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
  
- **State Management**: Use React's Context API for managing global state instead of prop drilling.

### SQL
- **Query Optimization**: Always analyze and optimize SQL queries for performance. Use indexing appropriately.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;
    ```

### JSON
- **Data Structures**: Use JSON to handle configurations and static data. Ensure that all JSON files are well-formed.

## 2. Project-Specific Patterns

### Directory Structure
- Follow the existing directory structure closely:
  - Place components in the `Components` directory.
  - Use the `Hooks` directory for custom hooks.
  - Keep API calls in the `Repositories` directory.

### Component Design
- **Atomic Design**: Adopt atomic design principles. Break components down into atoms, molecules, and organisms.
- **Styling**: Use a consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS-in-JS, styled-components, or a CSS framework).

### Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the `Docs` directory. Document components, hooks, and utilities thoroughly.

## 3. Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Use ESLint with TypeScript support to enforce coding styles. Run linting before committing.
- **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting. Ensure consistency in code style across the codebase.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - **Example**:
    ```typescript
    import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
    import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

    test('renders user name', () => {
        render(<UserProfile name="Alice" age={30} />);
        expect(screen.getByText(/Alice is 30 years old/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

### Code Reviews
- Conduct thorough code reviews before merging any pull requests. Use GitHub's review features to provide feedback.

## 4. Workflow Guidelines

### Version Control
- Use Git for version control. Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow) for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
- Commit messages should be clear and follow the format: `type(scope): subject`.
  - **Example**: `feat(user): add user authentication`

### Continuous Integration
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes. Ensure that tests pass before merging.

### Collaboration
- Use issue tracking for tasks and bugs. Assign issues to team members and update statuses regularly.

## 5. Security & Performance

### Security Practices
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) in environment variables.
- **Input Validation**: Validate user inputs on both client and server sides to prevent XSS and other attacks.

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for images and components to improve initial load times.
- **Minification**: Use tools like Webpack to minify JavaScript and CSS files for production builds.

### Monitoring
- Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, New Relic) to track application performance and errors in production.

## Tool Recommendations
- **ESLint**: For linting JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **Prettier**: For code formatting.
- **Jest**: For unit testing.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
- **Webpack**: For module bundling and optimizing assets.

## Quality Gates
- Ensure that all code passes linting and formatting checks before merging.
- Require that at least 80% test coverage is maintained throughout the codebase.
- Code reviews must be completed with at least one approving review before merging.

By adhering to these guidelines, developers can maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure the efficient functioning of the Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal project.
