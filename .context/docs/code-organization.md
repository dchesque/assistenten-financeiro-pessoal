# Code Organization Guide

This guide is designed to help developers navigate, understand, and extend the codebase effectively. By following the principles outlined here, you will be able to locate specific types of code, add new features, and comprehend how various components interact.

## 1. Directory Structure Logic

The directory structure is organized to promote modularity and maintainability. Each directory serves a specific purpose, allowing for better separation of concerns:

- **Components**: This directory contains reusable UI components. By isolating components, we can manage them independently, making it easier to maintain and test.
  
- **Config**: Holds configuration files necessary for the application’s environment setup. This centralizes configuration management, allowing easy adjustments without diving into the code.

- **Constants**: Contains constant values used throughout the application, promoting the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and making updates straightforward.

- **Docs**: Documentation files that provide insights into the application’s functionality, setup, and usage. This is crucial for onboarding new developers.

- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects in React components. This encourages reusability of logic across components.

- **Integrations**: Contains files related to third-party service integrations. This keeps external dependencies organized and easy to update.

- **Lib**: General utility functions that can be reused across various modules. This keeps code DRY and reduces redundancy.

- **Pages**: Contains top-level components that represent different views in the application. This helps in organizing the application’s routing structure.

- **Root Files**: Key configuration and entry point files necessary for the application to run. This centralizes important bootstrapping logic.

- **Services**: Contains files that manage interactions with external APIs. This encapsulation makes it easier to replace or modify service logic without affecting the rest of the application.

## 2. Module Boundaries

Each module has clear boundaries regarding what it contains:

- **Components**: UI elements, such as buttons, forms, and layout components. Any component that does not fit within the context of pages or services should be in this directory.

- **Config**: Configuration files, environment variables, and settings that dictate how the application behaves.

- **Constants**: Values like action types, API endpoints, and any other fixed values that need to be shared across modules.

- **Docs**: Documentation files that describe how to set up or use the application.

- **Hooks**: Functions for managing state and side effects in a reusable manner.

- **Integrations**: Code that sets up and handles interactions with external APIs or services.

- **Lib**: Utility functions that can be used in multiple parts of the application.

- **Pages**: Components that represent distinct views or routes within the application.

- **Root Files**: Core configuration files, such as tsconfig.json and package.json, and the main entry point of the application.

- **Services**: Logic for making API calls and handling responses.

## 3. Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are crucial for maintaining readability and consistency across the codebase:

- **Directories and Files**: Use lowercase and kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile`, `settings-config`) to clearly convey the purpose of each file or directory.

- **Components**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`, `SettingsPanel.tsx`) to distinguish them from regular functions.

- **Hooks**: Prefix custom hooks with `use` (e.g., `useFetchData.ts`, `useUserAuth.ts`) to signify their purpose and align with React's conventions.

- **Constants**: Use uppercase letters with underscores for constant values (e.g., `API_URL`, `MAX_RETRIES`) to differentiate them from variables.

- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase for regular functions and variable names (e.g., `getUserData`, `isLoggedIn`) to enhance clarity.

## 4. Dependency Flow

Understanding module dependencies is key to navigating the codebase:

- The **Root Files** module serves as the backbone, depending on other modules for configuration and essential functionality.

- The **Components** module depends on **Root Files** for configuration and may also utilize **Hooks** for state management.

- **Services** depend on **Components** to interact with the UI, ensuring API data is presented correctly.

- **Integrations** are independent but may rely on **Services** for handling API calls.

- The **Hooks** module can be used by both **Components** and **Pages**, allowing shared logic to be accessed by multiple views.

## 5. Extension Points

To add new functionality or features, consider the following extension points:

- **Adding New Components**: Place new UI components in the **Components** directory. Ensure they follow the established naming conventions and are reusable.

- **Creating New Hooks**: If you need to manage new state or side effects, create a new custom hook in the **Hooks** directory, prefixed with `use`.

- **Updating Configuration**: Modify or add configuration files in the **Config** directory as needed. This keeps your environment setup organized.

- **Creating New Services**: If you need to interact with new APIs, create a service file in the **Services** directory, encapsulating API logic and ensuring it can be reused.

- **Documentation**: Add or update documentation in the **Docs** directory to ensure all new features are well-documented for future reference.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively navigate the codebase, understand where to find specific types of code, and contribute new features in a structured and maintainable way.
