# Development Patterns

# Development Patterns Guide for Assistenten Financeiro Pessoal

## 1. Common Workflows

### Adding Features
- **When you need to add a new feature, do the following:**
  1. Identify the relevant module (e.g., `Components`, `Hooks`, `Pages`) where the feature will reside.
  2. Create a new file using the appropriate naming conventions (e.g., `FeatureName.tsx` for a component).
  3. Implement the feature, ensuring you follow the established coding patterns.
  4. Write necessary tests to cover the new functionality.
  5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what was added.

### Fixing Bugs
- **When you need to fix a bug, do the following:**
  1. Reproduce the issue to understand its scope and context.
  2. Locate the relevant file(s) and review the code for potential causes.
  3. Apply the fix while adhering to the coding standards and patterns.
  4. Test the fix locally.
  5. Document the bug and the fix in the pull request.

### Making Changes
- **When you need to make changes to existing code, do the following:**
  1. Review the current implementation and understand its purpose.
  2. Determine if the change impacts any interfaces or services.
  3. Make the required changes while respecting the existing coding conventions.
  4. Run tests to ensure existing functionality remains unaffected.
  5. Provide a summary of changes in your pull request.

## 2. Code Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- **This codebase prefers naming conventions that enhance readability:**
  - **Interfaces are prefixed with "I"**: E.g., `IUser`, `IProduct`.
  - **Services are suffixed with "Service"**: E.g., `UserService`.

### Design Patterns
- **When implementing new functionality, consider these established patterns:**
  - **Factory Pattern**: Use factory methods for object creation when you need to instantiate classes. 
    ```typescript
    class UserFactory {
        static createUser(data: UserData): IUser {
            return new User(data);
        }
    }
    ```
  - **Observer Pattern**: If your component needs to respond to changes in state or data, use the observer pattern.
    ```typescript
    class EventEmitter {
        private listeners: { [event: string]: Function[] } = {};
        
        on(event: string, listener: Function) {
            if (!this.listeners[event]) {
                this.listeners[event] = [];
            }
            this.listeners[event].push(listener);
        }
        
        emit(event: string, data: any) {
            if (this.listeners[event]) {
                this.listeners[event].forEach(listener => listener(data));
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## 3. Testing Strategy

- **When writing tests, follow these guidelines:**
  1. Use a dedicated testing framework (e.g., Jest).
  2. Write unit tests for individual components and services.
  3. Ensure all new features come with corresponding tests to validate functionality.
  4. Run all tests before merging any code to ensure no existing functionality is broken.

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
    it('should create a user successfully', () => {
        const user = UserService.createUser({ name: 'John' });
        expect(user.name).toBe('John');
    });
});
```

## 4. Error Handling

- **When handling errors, do the following:**
  1. Use try-catch blocks in asynchronous code to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
  2. Log errors to a central logging service or console with meaningful messages.
  3. Provide user-friendly error messages for UI components.

**Example:**
```typescript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const result = await apiCall();
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
        throw new Error('Data fetch error. Please try again later.');
    }
}
```

## 5. Performance Considerations

- **When optimizing for performance, keep the following in mind:**
  1. Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components by using `React.memo` or `useMemo`.
  2. Use lazy loading for components or routes that are not immediately needed.
  3. Minimize API calls by caching results where appropriate.
  4. Always profile your code using performance tools to identify bottlenecks.
  
**Example:**
```typescript
const UserProfile = React.memo(({ userId }) => {
    // Component logic
});
```
