## Decision 1: Modular Architecture

### Context
As the project aimed to manage personal finance effectively, it required a clean separation of concerns to facilitate scalability and maintainability. The complexity of integrating various functionalities necessitated a modular approach.

### Decision
A modular architecture was implemented, organizing the code into distinct modules such as Components, Hooks, Pages, and more.

### Rationale
This approach allows for better separation of responsibilities, making it easier for developers to navigate, understand, and modify specific parts of the application without affecting others. It also supports parallel development, where different teams can work on separate modules concurrently.

### Consequences
While this structure enhances maintainability, it may introduce complexity in module interactions. Developers need to understand the dependencies between modules, which could lead to confusion if not well-documented.

## Decision 2: TypeScript as the Primary Language

### Context
Given the need for a type-safe environment to manage complex data structures and minimize runtime errors, choosing a strongly typed language was crucial.

### Decision
TypeScript was chosen as the primary programming language, with both .tsx and .ts files comprising the majority of the codebase.

### Rationale
TypeScript provides static type-checking, which enhances code quality and developer productivity by catching errors at compile time. This is particularly beneficial in a collaborative environment where multiple developers work on the same codebase.

### Consequences
The main trade-off is the learning curve associated with TypeScript for developers familiar only with JavaScript. Additionally, the need for type definitions can lead to more verbose code, potentially slowing down initial development.

## Decision 3: Use of React for UI Components

### Context
The project required a responsive and dynamic user interface to effectively manage personal finance data. 

### Decision
React was selected as the library for building user interfaces, leveraging its component-based architecture.

### Rationale
Reactâ€™s reusable components promote code reusability and separation of concerns. Its virtual DOM improves performance, making UI updates efficient. This aligns well with the modular architecture, allowing components to be developed and tested independently.

### Consequences
While React simplifies UI management, it introduces a dependency on the React ecosystem, which may complicate migration efforts in the future. Additionally, developers must be familiar with React's lifecycle methods and hooks, which can add to the initial onboarding time.

## Decision 4: Integration with Supabase

### Context
The application required a backend service for data storage and authentication to manage user finance records effectively.

### Decision
Supabase was chosen as the backend service to handle database operations and user authentication.

### Rationale
Supabase provides a robust, open-source alternative to Firebase, offering easy integration with modern front-end frameworks. Its real-time capabilities and built-in authentication features align well with the application's requirements.

### Consequences
While using Supabase simplifies backend management, it ties the project to a specific service, which could present challenges if the project needs to scale or if the service undergoes significant changes.

## Decision 5: Code Organization Principles

### Context
To enhance code maintainability and readability, clear organizational principles were necessary.

### Decision
Files and directories were structured based on feature and functionality, with distinct modules for components, hooks, and pages, among others.

### Rationale
Organizing code by feature rather than by type (e.g., all components in one folder) allows developers to locate related files more easily, enhancing collaboration and reducing the time spent navigating the codebase.

### Consequences
The trade-off is that new developers must familiarize themselves with the chosen structure, which may differ from more traditional organization methods. It also requires disciplined adherence to the structure to avoid clutter and confusion over time.

## Decision 6: Use of Docker for Development

### Context
To ensure a consistent development environment across different machines and setups, containerization was necessary.

### Decision
Docker was adopted to manage the development and deployment environments.

### Rationale
Docker allows for creating isolated environments that replicate production conditions, thus minimizing the "it works on my machine" issues. This is especially useful in a team setting where different developers may have varying local setups.

### Consequences
The main trade-off involves the added complexity of managing Docker configurations and the initial setup time required for new developers unfamiliar with containerization technologies. However, the long-term benefits of consistency and scalability often outweigh these initial costs.
