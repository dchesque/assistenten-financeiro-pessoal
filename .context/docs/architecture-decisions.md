# Architecture Decision Records

# Architecture Decisions Document

## Decision 1: Modular Architecture

1. **Context**: As the application grew, the need for a maintainable and scalable codebase became crucial. The initial flat structure caused difficulties in managing complexity and understanding module relationships.

2. **Decision**: Implement a modular architecture, organizing the code into distinct modules such as Components, Hooks, Services, and Pages.

3. **Rationale**: This approach allows for better separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain each module independently. It facilitates collaboration among developers as each can work on different modules without causing conflicts.

4. **Consequences**: While modular architecture improves maintainability, it can lead to increased complexity in managing inter-module dependencies. Developers need to understand the boundaries and interactions between modules to avoid tight coupling.

## Decision 2: TypeScript for Type Safety 

1. **Context**: The need for robust type checking and improved developer experience was identified, especially in a large codebase with many contributors.

2. **Decision**: Use TypeScript as the primary programming language instead of JavaScript.

3. **Rationale**: TypeScript introduces static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code readability. It enhances tooling support, enabling better autocompletion and refactoring capabilities.

4. **Consequences**: Adopting TypeScript requires an initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with it. Additionally, the build process becomes slightly more complex due to the need for transpilation.

## Decision 3: React with TypeScript (.tsx files)

1. **Context**: The need for a dynamic and component-driven user interface was critical for the application’s user experience.

2. **Decision**: Utilize React as the front-end framework, complemented by TypeScript for type safety in the component structure.

3. **Rationale**: React's component-based architecture promotes reusability, and its virtual DOM offers performance benefits. Coupling this with TypeScript provides type safety within components, which is crucial for large applications.

4. **Consequences**: While React simplifies UI development, it can lead to over-engineering if components are not managed correctly. The learning curve for newcomers unfamiliar with both React and TypeScript may also be steep.

## Decision 4: Dependency Management with npm

1. **Context**: Managing third-party libraries and dependencies efficiently was vital for the project’s sustainability and consistency.

2. **Decision**: Adopt npm as the package manager for managing dependencies.

3. **Rationale**: npm provides a robust ecosystem for JavaScript libraries, allowing developers to easily install, update, and manage dependencies. It also simplifies the process of sharing code and collaborating with others.

4. **Consequences**: Relying on npm means that the project is susceptible to dependency issues and version conflicts. Regular updates and audits are necessary to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility.

---

## Decision 5: Use of Hooks for State Management

1. **Context**: The need for a clean and efficient way to manage state and side effects in functional components was critical to the application’s architecture.

2. **Decision**: Leverage React Hooks for managing component state and side effects instead of class components.

3. **Rationale**: Hooks allow for a more functional approach to state management, making the code less verbose and easier to follow. They enable better reuse of stateful logic through custom hooks.

4. **Consequences**: While Hooks provide a cleaner API, they can lead to challenges in understanding component lifecycles for developers new to React. Additionally, improper use of Hooks can lead to performance issues or bugs if not managed correctly.

## Decision 6: API Integration with Supabase

1. **Context**: The project required a backend solution that was easy to integrate and provided real-time capabilities.

2. **Decision**: Choose Supabase as the backend service for managing the database and authentication.

3. **Rationale**: Supabase offers a seamless integration with PostgreSQL, providing an instant RESTful API and real-time capabilities out of the box. This reduces the need for setting up a custom backend.

4. **Consequences**: While Supabase simplifies backend development, it may introduce vendor lock-in and restrict customization compared to a fully custom backend solution. Developers must also adapt to the specific API structure and limitations of Supabase.

---

## Decision 7: Documentation and Code Comments

1. **Context**: Ensuring that new developers can onboard quickly and understand the codebase was essential for maintaining productivity.

2. **Decision**: Emphasize thorough documentation within the code and maintain an up-to-date README.md file.

3. **Rationale**: Comprehensive documentation helps new developers understand the architecture, dependencies, and usage patterns, reducing the onboarding time and minimizing confusion.

4. **Consequences**: Maintaining accurate documentation requires ongoing effort and discipline. If not kept up-to-date, it can lead to misunderstandings or inconsistencies within the codebase.
