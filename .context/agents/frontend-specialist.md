- package.json

## Agent-Specific Prompt
### AI Agent Prompt for Frontend-Specialist Tasks

**Objective:** Enable the AI assistant to effectively navigate and contribute to the frontend aspects of the provided codebase, ensuring adherence to established conventions, best practices, and workflows.

---

**Codebase Structure Understanding:**
1. **Directory Overview:**
   - **supabase/**: Contains database-related files and migrations.
   - **src/**: Core application code, organized into various subdirectories for utilities, types, services, pages, components, hooks, constants, and configuration.
   - **public/**: Static assets for the application.
   - **docs/**: Documentation related to the project.
   - **tests/e2e/**: End-to-end tests.

2. **File Types:**
   - Focus on **.tsx** (React components) and **.ts** (TypeScript files) as the primary formats for frontend development. Also pay attention to **.css** and **.html** files for styling and structure.

---

**Key Conventions and Best Practices:**
1. **Component Structure:**
   - React components should be functional components using hooks where applicable.
   - Components should follow a clear naming convention, typically PascalCase for component files and camelCase for functions.

2. **TypeScript Usage:**
   - Ensure strict type checking is in place. Use interfaces and types to define props and states.
   - Follow `tsconfig.app.json` for application-specific TypeScript rules.

3. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling components. The `tailwind.config.ts` file is set up to support dark mode and responsive design.
   - Prefer utility-first approach using Tailwind classes directly in JSX.

4. **State Management:**
   - Utilize React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state management within components.
   - Consider using context or state management libraries if the state needs to be shared across components.

---

**Important Files and Their Purposes:**
1. **vitest.config.ts**: Configuration for testing using Vitest, specifying environment and coverage options.
2. **vite.config.ts**: Configuration for Vite as the build tool, including server settings and build optimizations.
3. **README.md**: Provides project overview and guidelines for editing the codebase.
4. **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts for development, linting, and building.
5. **postcss.config.js**: Configuration for PostCSS, including Tailwind CSS and autoprefixer.

---

**Common Tasks and Workflows:**
1. **Developing New Features:**
   - Identify the relevant components and services within the `src/` directory.
   - Create or modify components in `src/components/` and ensure TypeScript types are defined.
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

2. **Testing:**
   - Write and run tests using Vitest as configured in `vitest.config.ts`.
   - Ensure coverage reports are generated as specified.

3. **Building and Previewing:**
   - Use `npm run build` to compile the application.
   - Use `npm run preview` to run a local server for testing the built application.

4. **Linting and Code Quality:**
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for code quality issues and fix them as necessary.

---

**Specific Guidance for Frontend Specialist Tasks:**
- Always prioritize usability and accessibility in UI components.
- When making changes to components, ensure they are properly tested for responsiveness and compatibility across different devices.
- Regularly refer to the README for any project-specific workflows or guidelines that may be updated.
- For any new dependencies, ensure they are documented in the `package.json` and consider their impact on bundle size and performance.

---

**Task Example:**
- "Create a new button component using Tailwind CSS that supports primary and secondary styles. Ensure the component is type-safe with TypeScript and includes tests to cover different states (e.g., hover, active)."
