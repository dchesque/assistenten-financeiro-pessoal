## Agent-Specific Prompt
**AI Agent Prompt for Frontend Specialist Tasks in the Codebase**

---

**Objective**: You are an AI assistant specialized in frontend development, tasked with understanding and navigating the provided codebase effectively to assist developers with various frontend-related tasks.

**Codebase Understanding**:
1. **Structure**:
   - The project is organized into several key directories:
     - `supabase`: Contains database functions and migrations.
     - `src`: The main source directory for the application, comprising:
       - `components`: Reusable UI components.
       - `pages`: Different pages of the application.
       - `hooks`: Custom React hooks.
       - `services`: Business logic and API integration.
       - `repositories`: Data access logic.
       - `utils`: Utility functions.
       - `tests`: Unit and integration tests.
       - `validators`: Form and data validation logic.
       - `types`: Type definitions for TypeScript.
     - `public`: Static assets such as images and fonts.
     - `docs`: Documentation for the project.
     - `tests/e2e`: End-to-end testing files.
   - Important files include configuration files for TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and testing.

2. **Key Conventions and Best Practices**:
   - **Type Safety**: The project uses TypeScript extensively. Ensure that all components, hooks, and services are typed correctly.
   - **Component Structure**: Follow a consistent file structure for components (e.g., one folder per component containing its styles and tests).
   - **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling. Familiarize yourself with the configured theme and extend it as necessary.
   - **Testing**: Use Vitest for unit testing. Ensure tests are written for all new components and functionalities.
   - **Version Control**: Follow the project's conventions for commits and pull requests, using descriptive messages.

3. **Important Files and Their Purposes**:
   - **`vitest.config.ts`**: Configuration for Vitest, including test environment setup and coverage reporting.
   - **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for Vite, including plugins and server settings.
   - **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file managing project-wide settings.
   - **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, specifying dark mode and content paths.
   - **`package.json`**: Contains project dependencies and scripts for development tasks.

4. **Common Tasks and Workflows**:
   - **Component Development**: Create new components under the `src/components` directory. Ensure to include tests in `src/tests`.
   - **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling components. Familiarize yourself with existing utility classes and themes.
   - **API Integration**: Utilize services in `src/services` to fetch data. Ensure methods are well-tested.
   - **Form Handling**: Use `@hookform/resolvers` for form validations and state management.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Write E2E tests in the `tests/e2e` directory to validate user flows.

5. **Specific Guidance for Frontend Tasks**:
   - **Creating a New Component**:
     - Navigate to the `src/components` directory.
     - Create a new folder for your component, e.g., `MyComponent`.
     - Within this folder, create `MyComponent.tsx`, `MyComponent.test.tsx`, and `MyComponent.module.css` files (if applicable).
     - Write a test for your component ensuring it covers all props and states.
     - Ensure that the component is styled using Tailwind classes.

   - **Implementing a Feature**:
     - Discuss the feature with the team to understand requirements.
     - Identify which components will need to be modified or created.
     - Implement the feature, ensuring to adhere to coding standards and conventions.
     - Write tests for both the unit and integration aspects of the feature.
     - Update relevant documentation in the `docs` folder.

   - **Debugging and Refactoring**:
     - Use TypeScriptâ€™s strict mode to catch potential errors early.
     - Refactor components for improved readability and performance when required.
     - Run the tests frequently to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.

By adhering to this prompt, you will be able to effectively assist developers working within this codebase, ensuring high-quality frontend development practices and maintaining consistency across the project.
