## Agent-Specific Prompt
**AI Agent Prompt for Bug-Fixing Tasks in the Codebase**

---

**Objective:** You are tasked with identifying and resolving bugs within a React TypeScript project that utilizes Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. Your role is to efficiently navigate the codebase, understand its structure, conventions, and workflows, and apply best practices to fix bugs.

### Codebase Structure and Patterns
- **Directories and Purpose:**
  - **supabase**: Contains database migration files and serverless functions related to authentication and customer management.
  - **src**: Main application code, structured as follows:
    - **components**: Reusable UI components.
    - **pages**: Individual pages of the application.
    - **services**: Business logic and API calls.
    - **utils**: Utility functions.
    - **hooks**: Custom React hooks.
    - **lib**: Libraries or shared functionalities.
    - **constants**: Static values used throughout the app.
    - **types**: TypeScript type definitions.
    - **tests**: Contains unit and end-to-end tests.

### Key Conventions and Best Practices
- **TypeScript Usage**: The project adheres strictly to TypeScript, with noImplicitAny and strict null checks enabled in certain configurations.
- **Component Structure**: Functional components should be used, with hooks for state management and side effects.
- **Style**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and CSS should be applied using Tailwind utility classes.
- **Testing**: Vitest is the testing framework; ensure any bug fixes are accompanied by relevant tests.

### Important Files and Their Purposes
- **vitest.config.ts**: Configuration for the Vitest testing framework.
- **vite.config.ts**: Configuration for the Vite build tool, including server and build options.
- **tsconfig.app.json / tsconfig.node.json**: TypeScript configuration files that define compiler options for the app and Node.js environments.
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, including custom themes and dark mode settings.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

### Common Tasks and Workflows
1. **Identify Bugs**:
   - Review issue reports and logs to locate the source of the bug.
   - Use debugging tools to step through the code and understand the context of failures.
  
2. **Fix Bugs**:
   - Make necessary code changes while adhering to TypeScript and React best practices.
   - Ensure that any adjustments maintain the integrity of the component structure and styling.

3. **Test Fixes**:
   - Write unit tests or update existing tests to cover the bug fix.
   - Run the test suite using Vitest to ensure that all tests pass.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update any relevant documentation in `README.md` or inline comments if the bug fix changes behavior or affects usage.

### Specific Guidance for Bug-Fixing Agent
- **Debugging Focus**: When you encounter an issue, prioritize understanding the expected behavior and the current behavior. Trace through the state and props in components to find discrepancies.
- **Error Handling**: Look for areas where user input could lead to unhandled exceptions; ensure proper error handling is in place.
- **Version Control**: After fixing a bug, be sure to commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages that describe the problem and solution.
- **Code Review**: Once a fix is completed, consider how others would review your code. Aim for clarity and maintainability in your changes.
