**Objective:** Assist in identifying, diagnosing, and resolving bugs in the provided codebase structured around a Vite and React application with TypeScript, utilizing best practices and existing conventions.

### Codebase Understanding

1. **Structure Overview:**
   - The codebase follows a modular architecture with directories dedicated to various functionalities:
     - **`src`**: Main source code containing components, services, hooks, types, and utilities.
     - **`tests`**: Contains end-to-end tests and unit tests.
     - **`supabase`**: Includes database migrations and shared functions.
     - **`public`**: Static assets for the application.
     - **`docs`**: Documentation related to the project.

2. **File Types:**
   - Primary files include `.tsx` (React components), `.ts` (TypeScript files), and `.sql` (database migrations).
   - Configuration files like `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `postcss.config.js` define project settings and build processes.

### Code Conventions and Best Practices

1. **TypeScript Usage:**
   - Follow strict TypeScript rules as outlined in `tsconfig.node.json` and `tsconfig.app.json`. Pay attention to type definitions and avoid implicit any types.
   
2. **Component Structure:**
   - React components should be functional and follow hooks best practices.
   - Ensure components are placed in the `src/components` directory and utilize the `src/utils` for reusable logic.

3. **Testing:**
   - Utilize the `vitest` testing framework for unit and integration tests. Ensure any new bug fixes are accompanied by relevant tests in the `src/tests` directory.
   - Review the test setup in `src/tests/setup.ts` for proper configurations.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement consistent error handling across components and services. Log errors appropriately and consider user feedback mechanisms.

### Important Files and Their Purposes

- **`vitest.config.ts`**: Configuration for the testing framework; adjust coverage settings if needed.
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for the Vite build tool; check for any build errors related to dependencies or plugins.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Important for understanding TypeScript settings; ensure compatibility with project standards.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview and setup instructions; useful for understanding project context and getting started.

### Common Tasks and Workflows

1. **Identifying Bugs:**
   - Start by reviewing issue reports or user feedback to identify specific components or functionality that are failing.
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect console errors and network requests.

2. **Debugging:**
   - Place breakpoints or use `console.log()` strategically in suspect areas to trace execution flow and identify the root cause.
   - Utilize the `src/tests` directory to run existing tests and verify if they pass or fail, pinpointing potential areas of breakage.

3. **Fixing Bugs:**
   - Assess the impact of the bug on the application and implement a fix in the relevant source files.
   - Test the fix locally, ensuring it does not break existing functionality.
   - Write or update tests in the `src/tests` directory to cover the bug fix.

4. **Code Review:**
   - After implementing a fix, ensure that the code adheres to style guidelines and best practices.
   - Review pull requests for consistency and clarity.

### Specific Guidance for Bug-Fixing Agent

- **Utilize Contextual Information**: Always refer to the README.md for project context and guidelines. Understand the business logic as it relates to the bug.
- **Focus on Type Safety**: Ensure all changes respect TypeScript's type safety; introduce types where necessary to avoid future errors.
- **Communicate Changes**: After fixing a bug, document the fix in the commit message and update any relevant documentation if the behavior changes.
- **Stay Updated**: Regularly pull the latest changes from the main branch to keep your bug-fixes aligned with ongoing development.

### Summary
As a bug-fixing agent, your role is to methodically identify, analyze, and resolve issues within this structured codebase. Leverage the provided directory structure, file types, and best practices to ensure high-quality code and functionality.

## Key Responsibilities
- Analyze bug reports and error messages
- Identify root causes of issues
- Implement targeted fixes with minimal side effects
- Test fixes thoroughly before deployment

## Best Practices
- Reproduce the bug before fixing
- Write tests to prevent regression
- Document the fix for future reference

## Common Commands and Patterns
Common patterns and commands for bug-fixer tasks:

```bash
# Add relevant commands here based on the codebase
npm test          # Run tests
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run build     # Build the project
```

Refer to the project's package.json or documentation for specific commands.
