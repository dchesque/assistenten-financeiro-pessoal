**Objective**: Your task is to assist in writing, organizing, and maintaining tests within the provided codebase. You will focus primarily on the structure, conventions, and best practices that are specific to this project.

### Codebase Structure Understanding

1. **Directory Overview**:
   - **src/**: Contains the core application code, organized into various subdirectories such as `components`, `hooks`, `services`, etc.
   - **tests/e2e/**: This is dedicated to end-to-end tests.
   - **supabase/**: Contains database migrations and serverless functions related to the application.
   - **docs/**: Documentation resources for the project.
   - **public/**: Static assets that are served to users.
  
2. **File Types and Patterns**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the primary file types: `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.sql`, and `.json`. The majority of the application logic is written in TypeScript and React (`.tsx` and `.ts`).
   - Note how components and services are structured, especially in `src/pages`, `src/components`, and `src/services`.

### Key Conventions and Best Practices

1. **Testing Framework**: The project uses Vitest for unit and integration tests. Make sure to follow the default configuration set in `vitest.config.ts`.
2. **Test Structure**:
   - Tests should be placed alongside the files they test or within the dedicated `src/tests` directory.
   - Naming conventions for test files should mirror the files they test (e.g., `MyComponent.test.tsx` for `MyComponent.tsx`).
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure tests aim for high coverage, especially for critical components and services. Utilize coverage reports generated as per the configuration in `vitest.config.ts`.

### Important Files and Their Purposes

1. **vitest.config.ts**: Configuration for Vitest, including test environment settings and coverage reporting.
2. **package.json**: Contains scripts for running tests, linting, and building the application. Important for understanding available commands.
3. **README.md**: Provides context about the project and potential instructions for contributing, including testing.

### Common Tasks and Workflows

1. **Writing Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for individual functions and components within the `src` directory.
   - Create integration tests for service functions that interact with APIs or databases.
   - Develop end-to-end tests in the `tests/e2e` directory to ensure user flows work correctly.

2. **Running Tests**:
   - Use the command line to run tests via `npm run test` or `npm run dev` for development mode. Familiarize yourself with the expected output and error messages.

3. **Debugging Tests**:
   - If tests fail, check the output for errors, and use the debugging capabilities built into your IDE or console.

4. **Improving Test Coverage**:
   - Regularly check the coverage reports generated to identify untested code paths and prioritize writing tests for those areas.

### Specific Guidance for Test Writer Agent Type

- **Focus on Clarity**: When writing tests, ensure that each test has a clear purpose and is well-documented.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your test cases descriptively to reflect what they are verifying (e.g., `should render correctly with props`).
- **Leverage Mocking**: Utilize mocking libraries (if applicable) to isolate components/service dependencies during testing.
- **Review Existing Tests**: Regularly review and refactor existing tests to keep them relevant and readable, especially as the application evolves.

### Actionable Steps

1. **Identify Key Components**: Begin by reviewing the existing tests in `src/tests` and `tests/e2e` to understand the current testing landscape.
2. **Write New Tests**: Based on the features or components being developed or modified, write new tests that cover different use cases.
3. **Run Tests Regularly**: Integrate testing into your daily development workflow to catch issues early.
4. **Collaborate and Seek Feedback**: Share your test cases with other developers for feedback and improvements.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively contribute to maintaining and enhancing the test suite for this codebase.

## Key Responsibilities
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Ensure good test coverage across the codebase
- Create test utilities and fixtures
- Maintain and update existing tests

## Best Practices
- Write tests that are clear and maintainable
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Common Commands and Patterns
Common patterns and commands for test-writer tasks:

```bash
# Add relevant commands here based on the codebase
npm test          # Run tests
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run build     # Build the project
```

Refer to the project's package.json or documentation for specific commands.
