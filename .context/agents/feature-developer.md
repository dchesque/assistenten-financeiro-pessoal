**Overview: Understanding the Codebase**

You are tasked with assisting in feature development for a React-based application utilizing TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This codebase also integrates Supabase for backend functionality. Your goal is to comprehend the structure, conventions, and workflows to effectively contribute to the development of new features.

---

### 1. Codebase Structure and Patterns

- **Directories:**
  - **supabase**: Contains Supabase-related configurations and functions, including migrations and shared functions.
  - **src**: The main application logic, divided into various subdirectories:
    - **utils**: Utility functions.
    - **types**: TypeScript type definitions.
    - **tests**: Unit and integration tests.
    - **services**: Business logic and API service interactions.
    - **pages**: Page components for routing.
    - **lib**: Shared libraries and components.
    - **hooks**: Custom React hooks.
    - **constants**: Constant values used throughout the app.
    - **config**: Configuration files, such as for environment settings.
    - **components**: Reusable UI components.
    - **assets**: Static assets like images and icons.
  - **public**: Static files served directly (e.g., index.html).
  - **docs**: Documentation files.
  - **tests\e2e**: End-to-end testing files.

- **File Types:**
  - **.tsx** and **.ts**: TypeScript files for React components and logic.
  - **.sql**: SQL files for database migrations.
  - **.json**: Configuration and data files.

---

### 2. Key Conventions and Best Practices

- **TypeScript Usage**: Ensure strict type checking is followed. Use TypeScript interfaces and types for props and state management.
- **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for component files and ensure filenames match the component name.
- **Hooks**: Follow React Hooks rules (e.g., only call hooks at the top level).
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling components. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility.
- **Testing**: Use Vitest for unit tests. Write tests for new features in the src/tests directory, following existing patterns.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes with clear, concise messages that describe the feature or fix implemented.

---

### 3. Important Files and Their Purposes

- **vitest.config.ts**: Configuration for Vitest testing framework.
- **vite.config.ts**: Vite configuration for building the application and setting up aliases.
- **tsconfig.*.json**: TypeScript configuration files that define compiler options for different environments (app vs. node).
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, defining dark mode and content paths.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata, scripts for running, building, and testing the application.
- **README.md**: Documentation on project setup and usage.

---

### 4. Common Tasks and Workflows

- **Feature Development**:
  1. Identify a feature requirement from the project backlog or discussions.
  2. Create a new branch for the feature.
  3. Develop the feature in the appropriate directory (likely `src/pages` or `src/components`).
  4. Write corresponding tests in `src/tests`.
  5. Run the application locally using `npm run dev` to test the feature.
  6. Ensure the feature is styled using Tailwind CSS and adheres to accessibility standards.

- **Testing**:
  - Run tests locally with `npm run test`.
  - Ensure coverage metrics are met as defined in the Vitest configuration.

- **Documentation**:
  - Update the README.md or other relevant documentation files to reflect new features and usage.

---

### 5. Specific Guidance for Feature Development

- **Integrate with Supabase**: When developing features that require backend interaction, use the existing Supabase service functions in `src/services`. Familiarize yourself with the data models and APIs defined in the Supabase project.
  
- **Use TypeScript Effectively**: Ensure all new components and functions are strongly typed and utilize TypeScript's capabilities to catch errors early.

- **Follow Existing Patterns**: When creating new components or pages, follow existing component structures and patterns established in the codebase to maintain consistency.

- **Version Control Best Practices**: Regularly commit changes with descriptive messages and sync your branch with the main branch to avoid conflicts.

---

By adhering to this structure and guidance, you will effectively contribute to the development of new features within the codebase. Always reference the important files and maintain the project's coding standards to ensure a smooth development experience.

## Key Responsibilities
- Implement new features according to specifications
- Design clean, maintainable code architecture
- Integrate features with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Best Practices
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write tests alongside implementation

## Common Commands and Patterns
Common patterns and commands for feature-developer tasks:

```bash
# Add relevant commands here based on the codebase
npm test          # Run tests
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run build     # Build the project
```

Refer to the project's package.json or documentation for specific commands.
