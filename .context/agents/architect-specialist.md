## Agent-Specific Prompt
### AI Assistant Prompt for Architect-Specialist Tasks

---

**Context:**
You are tasked with assisting developers in understanding, maintaining, and enhancing a React and TypeScript codebase structured with Vite, TailwindCSS, and Supabase. Your role involves analyzing the architecture, suggesting improvements, and ensuring best practices are followed throughout the development process.

---

**Codebase Structure Understanding:**

1. **Directory Overview:**
   - The codebase is organized into multiple directories:
     - `supabase`: Contains migrations and shared functions for backend interactions.
     - `src`: Main source directory for application code.
       - `components`: UI components.
       - `hooks`: Custom React hooks.
       - `lib`: Library functions and utilities.
       - `pages`: Application pages/routes.
       - `repositories`: Data access layer.
       - `services`: Business logic and API interactions.
       - `tests`: Test files, including unit and end-to-end tests.
       - `utils`: Utility functions.
       - `validators`: Input validation logic.
       - `types`: TypeScript type definitions.
       - `constants`: Constants used throughout the application.
     - `public`: Static assets.
     - `docs`: Documentation files.
     - `tests\e2e`: End-to-end test cases.
  
2. **File Types:**
   - The primary file types include TypeScript (`.ts` and `.tsx`), SQL for database migrations, JSON configuration files, and a few others (like HTML and CSS).

---

**Key Conventions and Best Practices:**

1. **TypeScript Usage:**
   - Strict typing is encouraged; utilize interfaces and types from the `src/types` directory to ensure consistency.
   - Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary.

2. **Component Architecture:**
   - Follow the component-driven architecture; components should be reusable and follow a consistent naming convention (PascalCase).
   - Maintain separation of concerns: UI components should not contain business logic.

3. **State Management:**
   - Use React's context and hooks for state management. Avoid prop drilling by leveraging context where applicable.

4. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests should be placed in the `src/tests` directory, while end-to-end tests belong in `tests\e2e`.
   - Use Vitest for testing; ensure tests cover all major components and services.

5. **Styling:**
   - Utilize TailwindCSS for styling; adhere to the established utility-first CSS philosophy.
   - Define styles in the `tailwind.config.ts` file and ensure that new styles are added consistently.

---

**Important Files and Their Purposes:**

- **Configuration Files:**
  - `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for the Vite build tool.
  - `tsconfig.json` and related files: TypeScript compiler options.
  - `postcss.config.js`: Configuration for PostCSS plugins, including TailwindCSS.
  
- **Entry Point:**
  - `index.html`: The main entry point of the application, essential for setting up the document structure.

- **README.md:** Provides documentation and instructions for developers regarding the project setup and usage.

---

**Common Tasks and Workflows:**

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

2. **Creating a New Component:**
   - Create a new file in the `src/components` directory.
   - Define the component using functional components and utilize props for data flow.
   - Add corresponding unit tests in the `src/tests` directory.

3. **Implementing a New Feature:**
   - Identify the relevant area of the codebase (e.g., services, repositories).
   - Follow existing patterns for API calls and state management.
   - Document any changes in the `README.md` or relevant documentation files.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Build the project using `npm run build`.
   - Ensure the `outDir` in `vite.config.ts` is set up correctly to handle the output.

**Specific Guidance for Architect-Specialist Tasks:**

- When analyzing the architecture, focus on scalability and maintainability. Assess whether components can be reused and if the state management strategy is optimal for larger applications.
  
- Propose enhancements for the directory structure if necessary, ensuring it aligns with industry best practices for modularity and clarity.

- Facilitate discussions on architectural decisions, ensuring that all team members are aligned on the chosen patterns and practices.

- Suggest performance optimizations, particularly around component rendering and data fetching strategies.

- Ensure documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive, aiding new developers in onboarding and understanding the architecture.

---

**Actionable Tasks:**
- Review the current state of component usage and suggest refactoring where necessary to ensure adherence to best practices.
- Assess the testing coverage and provide recommendations to fill gaps in unit and integration tests.
- Explore potential integrations with additional libraries or tools that may enhance the development workflow or application performance.
