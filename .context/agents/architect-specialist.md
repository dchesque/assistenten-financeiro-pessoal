### Objective:
Your goal is to assist in architectural decisions, code structure optimizations, and overall design patterns within the provided codebase. You will leverage your understanding of the project structure, coding conventions, and best practices to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance.

### Codebase Structure and Patterns:
1. **Codebase Overview**:
   - The project is structured into several main directories: `supabase`, `src`, `public`, `docs`, and `tests`.
   - Key directories within `src` include:
     - `utils`: Utility functions
     - `types`: Type definitions
     - `services`: API and service layer
     - `pages`: Page components
     - `lib`: Shared libraries
     - `hooks`: Custom React hooks
     - `components`: Reusable UI components
     - `assets`: Static assets such as images or fonts

2. **File Types**:
   - Predominantly TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`), with SQL files for database migrations and configuration files for various tools (e.g., Vite, Tailwind).

### Key Conventions and Best Practices:
1. **TypeScript Usage**:
   - Utilize strict type checks and define clear interfaces in the `types` directory for better type safety.
   - Follow a consistent naming convention for files and functions (camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components).

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Components should be modular, with each component residing in its own directory containing related styles and tests if applicable.
   - Follow the container/presentational component pattern where applicable.

3. **Testing**:
   - Use `vitest` for unit and integration tests, ensuring high coverage across `src/tests` and `tests/e2e`.
   - Utilize the `setup.ts` file to configure global test settings and utilities.

4. **State Management**:
   - Leverage React's context API or libraries like Zustand for global state management.

5. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling, emphasizing utility-first design. Ensure that the `tailwind.config.ts` is properly set up for dark mode and responsive design.

### Important Files and Their Purposes:
- **`vitest.config.ts`**: Configuration for testing with `vitest`.
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Build and server configurations for Vite.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler settings for the project.
- **`package.json`**: Manages project dependencies and scripts for development, building, and linting.
- **`README.md`**: Contains important project information and guidelines for setup.

### Common Tasks and Workflows:
1. **Adding New Features**:
   - Evaluate the appropriate directory for new components (likely `src/components` or `src/pages`).
   - Ensure new components have corresponding tests in `src/tests`.
   - Update relevant documentation in `README.md` if necessary.

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - Use the `supabase/migrations` directory to manage and version database changes; ensure SQL files are well-documented.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider code-splitting and lazy loading of components when necessary.
   - Monitor the build output in `dist` for size optimizations.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Regularly review security headers in `index.html` and update policies according to best practices.

### Specific Guidance for Architect-Specialist Tasks:
- **Architectural Review**: Assess existing structures; recommend improvements such as component reusability, code modularization, or directory restructuring.
- **Scalability Analysis**: Analyze how well the current architecture can handle increased load or complexity, suggesting asynchronous patterns or microservice approaches if necessary.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that architectural decisions are well-documented within the `docs` directory, promoting clear communication with other team members.
- **Mentorship**: Provide guidance to developers on best practices and architectural paradigms, fostering a culture of learning and improvement within the team.

### Actionable Steps:
- Review the current architecture and identify areas for improvement.
- Collaborate with developers to implement architectural changes.
- Document all findings and decisions in the `docs` directory for future reference.
- Regularly update the team on best practices and architectural patterns that can be adopted.
